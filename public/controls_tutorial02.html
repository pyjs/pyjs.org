<h2>Widget Event Handling and Capture for Pyjamas Widgets</h2>
<p>
    Our <a href="./controls_tutorial.html">simple slider widget</a>
    receives a basic "click" to move the slider.  Of much more interest
    to us is to be able to drag and move the slider.  Hints were given
    at the end of that previous tutorial on how to go about creating your own
    onBrowserEvent() function, and this tutorial will cover events
    such as drag and move, and keyboard events such as up and down.

<h3>Vertical Slider 2</h3>
<p>
    As we already have a demo slider to work from, we're going to derive
    from that as a base class.  Our primary focus is to add mouse event
    handling - up, down, and move.
</p>
<pre class="code">
class VerticalDemoSlider2(VerticalDemoSlider):

    def __init__(self, min_value, max_value, start_value=None):

        VerticalDemoSlider.__init__(self, min_value, max_value, start_value)
        self.mouseListeners = []
        self.addMouseListener(self)
        self.sinkEvents(Event.MOUSEEVENTS)
        self.dragging = False

    def addMouseListener(self, listener):
        self.mouseListeners.append(listener)

    def removeMouseListener(self, listener):
        self.mouseListeners.remove(listener)
</pre>
<p>
    Here, we derive from VerticalDemoSlider, add ourselves as a "mouse
    listener" - and indicate to the DOM model that we would like to
    receive notifications about all Mouse Events.  So, when the mouse
    moves into the widget, we receive a "mouse enter" event; we then also
    receive all move, down and up events, and, when the mouse moves out,
    we receive a mouse "leave" event.  All of these events will result
    in onBrowserEvent being called, which is the next key function needed:
</p>
<pre class="code">
    def onBrowserEvent(self, event):
        type = DOM.eventGetType(event)
        if type == "mousedown" or type == "mouseup" or type == "mousemove" or type == "mouseover" or type == "mouseout":
            MouseListener().fireMouseEvent(self.mouseListeners, self, event)


</pre>
<p>
    Here, as you can see, it's very straightforward: mouse events are
    passed to a convenience function - fireMouseEvent - which will call
    the appropriate handler functions on each of the listeners.  Examining
    fireMouseEvent, we see that there are five possible functions that
    could be called (on every one of the listeners, in turn); onMouseDown,
    onMouseUp, onMouseMove, onMouseLeave and onMouseEnter.
</p>
<p>
    onMouseEnter and onMouseLeave, we are not going to concern ourselves
    with, so we make those do nothing.  However, if we wanted to make
    the slider visually "respond" to the mouse hovering over the slider,
    it is these two functions which would take care of that.
</p>
<pre class="code">
    def onMouseEnter(self, sender):
        pass
    def onMouseLeave(self, sender):
        pass
</pre>
<p>
    The core of the work is done in the remaining three functions.
    Firstly, onMouseMove, which takes care of translating the mouse
    pointer's absolute y position into actual movement of the slider:
</p>
<pre class="code">
    def onMouseMove(self, sender, x, y):
        if not self.dragging:
            return
        self.moveSlider(y)
</pre>
<p>
    Notice how we only allow slider movement when "dragging" is set?
    If we didn't do this, then the slider would immediately start to
    jump and move when the mouse cursor was placed over the widget.
    This isn't what we want: we only want the slider to move when
    a mouse button is held down:
</p>
<pre class="code">
    def onMouseDown(self, sender, x, y):
        self.dragging = True
        DOM.setCapture(self.getElement())
        self.moveSlider(y)
</pre>
<p>
    So, when a mouse down event occurs, we set the "dragging" flag
    to True, indicate that we want to capture all future events into
    this widget, and we also move the slider.  The reason for moving
    the slider is because it is a separate event from "mouse move",
    and people will get rather annoyed if they click the "mouse button"
    and see the slider staying where it is.  The reason for capturing
    mouse events from now on is because people will quite likely
    move the mouse <i>out</i> of the widget whilst the button is still
    held down, and they will expect the slider to still move.  Only
    when they let go of the mouse button will they expect the slider
    to stop moving about:
</p>
<pre class="code">
    def onMouseUp(self, sender, x, y):
        self.dragging = False
        DOM.releaseCapture(self.getElement())
</pre>
<p>
    So, here you can see, we simply indicate that we no longer want
    the slider to move about when "mouse move" events occur, and we
    also cancel the capturing of all events.  This is all that's required:
    the majority of the user-interface hard work was done in the previous
    tutorial - all we're doing here is calling VerticalDemoSlider.moveSlider()
    at the appropriate times.
