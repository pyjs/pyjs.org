Pyjamas: Write your own AJAX Framework
</span></big>
</div>
<h2> <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 153);">Pyjamas</span> FAQ</h2>

This is the FAQ on Pyjamas, the python-to-javascript compiler and
Python Web Widget Toolkit.  For any questions not answered here please
contact the pyjamasdev mailing list at pyjamasdev@pyjs.org.

<h3> What is <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 153);">pyjamas</span>?</h3>
<p>
 <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 153); font-weight: bold;">pyjamas</span>
is a stand-alone python to javascript compiler, an AJAX framework / library
and a Widget set API.  
</p>
<h3> Is pyjamas like "yet another AJAX framework?" </h3>
<p>
Nope.  "standard" AJAX frameworks and widget sets are written in javascript,
a low-level alien language with weird complexities that is often confused
with not only the browsers it runs on but also the DOM model set of functions
that are provided as standard with the browsers.  When you use a "standard"
AJAX framework, there is an expectation that you will just "use" it - never
look at the framework, never get involved with its development or improvement,
and if that AJAX framework doesn't do what you want, tough luck - find another
one.
</p>
<p>
Pyjamas is a totally different approach: it brings "Declarative
Programming" (in python) to the Web.  You are given a comprehensive set of
base classes and modules - written almost 98.5% in python - and you can
then write your own applications, classes and modules and call it
"My Own AJAX Framework".  And, as you are writing in a much higher
level language than Javascript, it's a darn sight easier.
</p>

<h3> Is Pyjamas a server-side web framework? </h3>
<p>
No.
</p>

<h3> Is Pyjamas a client-side browser plugin? </h3>
<p>
No.
</p>

<h3> Is Pyjamas a firefox extension (like pyxpcomext)? </h3>
<p>
No.
</p>

<h3> Does it fly? </h3>
<p>
No.
</p>

<h3> Is Pyjamas a bird or a plane? </h3>
<p>
No.
</p>

<h3> How come you can run python, then? </h3>
<p>
You can't: browsers only support javascript.  So, all source code - libraries
and applications - are translated into pure javascript.  No python is left. 
at all.  Otherwise, it wouldn't work, would it?
</p>

<h3> How does it work, then? </h3>
<p>
It's magic.  smoke.  mirrors.  the usual stuff.
</p>

<h3> Do I have to know any Javascript? </h3>
<p>
Nope.
</p>

<h3> Do I have to know any Web Programming? </h3>
<p>
Nope.
</p>
<p>
It helps if you know a little bit about how CSS works, because
the Pyjamas User-Interface widgets, like all Widget Sets, are designed
around "function" and "purpose", not "form" or "look".  It would also help
if you had a basic grasp of a tiny bit of HTML, such as what &lt;b&gt; etc.
does.  For everything else, such as tables, there are Widgets such as Grid
that are much more practical to use.
</p>

<h3> Why not? </h3>
<p>
Pyjamas Web development actually has more in common with Python-Qt4
and Python-GTK2 than it does with "traditional" web development.
The base widgets (of which there are over 50) have almost exact
corresponding analogues in Desktop Widget sets.  The nice thing about
Pyjamas, though, when compared to the Desktop Widget frameworks is that you
get "true" HTML / CSS interoperability, and "true" plugin support such as
Adobe Flash, all for free.
</p>

<h3> I've never done User-Interfaces before - how do I get started? </h3>
<p>
We get quite a number of people who have never done user-interface
programming before in their lives on the pyjamas-dev mailing lists,
let alone having done any web programming: you're in good company.
</p>
<p>
Start with the <a href="./getting_started.html">"getting started"</a>
tutorial, ignoring the first paragraphs because they don't
apply to you!  Many web designers actually have to "unlearn"
their expectations that this is going to be horrendously painful,
and you are at a distinct advantage because you've not experienced
their disillusionment and frustration of the past decade, over CSS,
browser and AJAX incompatibilities.
</p>

<h3> I want to include python module X in my application. can I? </h3>
<p>
Browsers only support javascript, and pyjs is a python-to-javascript
compiler (strictly speaking, a language translator).  Therefore, any
python module, written in pure python, stands a good chance of working
(such as <a href="http://puremvc.org">PureMVC</a>).  For anything that's
written in c, you stand absolutely zero chance, and that's the end of it.
However, you can always use a python-based Web Server Framework, and
execute whatever python module you choose, server-side, then ship whatever
results you choose back to the browser, just like you would with any other
web application.
</p>
<p>
The Pyjamas UI Widget Set and supporting DOM module and other infrastructure
is, by the time it ends up as javascript, absolutely no different from any
other javascript-based Web Browser Framework - <b>other</b> than the fact
that the <b>original</b> language was Python, and other than the fact that
Pyjamas-Desktop exists.  So, you <b>could</b> include python module X in
your application, <b>if</b> you run it under Pyjamas-Desktop - but that is
strongly discouraged, for two reasons.  Firstly, you stand zero chance of
compiling the same application to javascript, should you ever wish to run it
in a Web Browser.  Secondly, the Web Engines used by Pyjamas-Desktop are
effectively single-threaded, and, just like with PyQt4 and PyGTK2, control
must be handed back quickly to the internal top-level event-handling loop.
So, if you execute some CPU-intensive code (in python module X), the entire
application visually grinds to a halt and becomes totally unresponsive, just
like an overloaded Web Browser, waiting for that code to complete.  To avoid
this situation, you should use the exact same asynchronous tricks used when
code is executed in browsers: AJAX to communicate with a Web Server Framework.
(yes, Pyjamas-Desktop supports XMLHttpRequest: for the above reasons,
it is strongly recommended that you use it).
</p>

<h3> What server-side web framework should I use? </h3>
<p>
Absolutely anything you like.  Literally anything.  CGI-Scripts,
ASP/.NET, PHP, Apache, WSGI - you name it, you can use it.  The
reason is simple: the Pyjamas python code gets compiled to some
HTML and some Javascript - that's it.  So, just like <i>any</i>
web pages, you simply need something that will load ... web pages.
duh.
</p>

<h3> Ok - what's the <i>best</i> server-side web framework I should use? </h3>
<p>
This is a highly subjective question, but if you are new to web development,
you will be asking these kinds of questions.  Given that you're considering
python, logically it makes sense to pick a python-based web framework.
If you're going to do AJAX, you should really use JSONRPC.  If you're
using JSONRPC, you should pick a framework that is known to have mature
JSONRPC server-side support, and that means
<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>,
<a href="http://web2py.com">Web2Py</a>, 
<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>, and many more.  See the
<a href="http://pyjs.org/wiki/">Pyjamas Wiki</a>
for links to various JSONRPC integration HOWTOs.
</p>
<p>
That having been said: if you're starting entirely from scratch,
Django has to come out overall on top, even though you will not be
using all of its features.  The SQL ORM in Django is excellent;
the tutorials to get started are excellent; the developers and users
on the (busy) IRC channel are very helpful and responsive.
</p>

<h3> I have an existing Django (or other app) that I want to convert to Pyjamas, how do I do that? </h3>
<p>
Unless you have already designed the application to exclusively use AJAX
in one form or another (REST, JSONRPC etc.) then it's pretty much a complete
redesign.  The reason is simple: "standard" web applications load up one
page at a time from the server, with possibly some bits of javascript
thrown in.  Pyjamas applications are loaded <b>once</b>, as they are
<b>pure javascript</b>.
</p>
<p>
From that point onwards, unless you want another large javascript "hit",
the entire application should use AJAX to fetch any data, including
HTML.  If that sounds like it's a bit different from "normal" web applications,
you'd be right.  It's more like "Desktop" application development.
</p>
<p>
So - you can convert the Django (or other web app) one page at a
time, to a format which separates out the data from its display.
In other words: by the time you're done, there will be <b>no</b>
templates left, only JSONRPC services (or other AJAX service /
system).  If that sounds like a lot of work, then you can temporarily
embed the templates on-demand into iframes, either using a
<tt>pyjamas.ui.HTMLPanel</tt> or by using a <tt>pyjamas.ui.Frame</tt>
widget.  If you've been told that Frames are a bad idea, you'd be
right in the "normal" web development world, but completely wrong in
this "Desktop-like" case.  Thanks to the Pyjamas API, it's possible
to set width and height and to react to Window Resize events, and
thus to change the entire layout of the application depending on
the user preferences, requirements, browser type and window size
(as is done in the Pyjamas
<a href="http://pyjs.org/examples/mail/output/Mail.html">Mail</a>
example).
</p>

<h3> I'm a bit underwhelmed by the apparent lack of documentation </h3>
<p>
Pyjamas is an independent free software project that is used by people
who prefer to actually get on with the job of writing apps, rather than
glorying or revelling in the frustration of "traditional" web development.
Hitting your head against a wall continuously every day doesn't hurt any
more when you stop doing it, and much of "traditional" web development -
of dealing with all the browser incompatibilities at a low level - can be
considered to be the same as brick-wall-nutting.
</p>
<p>
In other words, you're here gaining the benefit of the experience
of people who have spent quite some time searching out - and then
improving - the Pyjamas Technology, to make their own lives easier.
If there's an area which isn't clearly documented, you might like
to consider funding them to tell you about it.
</p>
<p>
That having been said, there is actually one heck of a lot of documentation:
see the main <a href="http://pyjs.org">Pyjamas</a> site for links to the
tutorials, the Pyjamas Book, the API reference guides, the Showcase
example which includes source code examples for each type of Widget and
Panel (that can be cut/pasted into your app), and much more.  If that
wasn't enough, the GWT User-Interface modules on which the Pyjamas UI
modules are based are so similar that even the GWT documentation is still
relevant and useful.
</p>

<h3> I'm a bit underwhelmed by the apparent lack of documentation on XML and DOM</h3>
<p>
That's because there's a ton of documentation on the W3C standard DOM Model
and the W3C standard browser XML standard, and duplicating that in the
Pyjamas project would be a great deal of work and would imply that the
Pyjamas project is somehow an authority over-and-above the W3C.
Use a google search for "W3C DOM XML", "W3C DOM", "W3C DOM Javascript"
and other such searches to find so much documentation and help on the
subject that you'll be staring at it for days.
</p>
<p>
Then, start by looking at pyjamas/DOM.py and you will notice that there
is a massive prevalance of javascript snippets (way more than any other
pyjamas module).  It should be plain as day that DOM.py is a way to make
the W3C DOM model of web browsers appear to be easily accessible, in python.
</p>

<h3> I'm developing my app, I need help: what do I do? </h3>
<p>
Lots of things.  
<ul>
<li /> First: read the question below.  Try to resolve the issue yourself.
<li /> Second: read the outstanding bugreports at
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyjamas/issues">pyjamas bugreports</a>.
       Is there anything that vaguely looks related?  Read up on it.
       Does the discussion there have any resolution?
<li /> Third: decide whether the issue is best reported to the bugtracker
       or to pyjamas-dev or to both.  The point of the bugtracker is to
       be a formal record of issues that need to be fixed.  People's
       heads don't hold large amounts of information all the time, and
       priorities have to be assigned to tasks.  If you want the issue
       to be fixed for you, you need to make life easier not less easy
       for the developers to fix it.
<li /> Fourth: if you decide to contact pyjamas-dev, <b>before</b> you do so,
       there are some important things that you need to be aware of.
<li /> pyjamas is a part-time community-driven project, not a
       corporate-funded one.  your absolute top priority in contacting
       the development list is therefore to make it easy for people
       to respond.  the way to make it easy for people to respond is to do
       your homework: to provide absolute unambiguous and full information
       necessary to get people "up to speed".
<li /> To that end: if you have a problem, provide a complete worked example
       that can be downloaded and run as-is, with no additional effort
       required other than a few simple commands to install it and run it.
<li /> Provide full context.
<li /> Provide <b>full</b> context.
<li /> Provide <b>full context</b>.
<li /> Provide the version of the compiler; the version of python; the
       operating system; provide a complete list of all commands that
       had been run in order to get you to the point where you are, now.
<li /> If you are running an out-of-date version of the compiler, update
       the application to the latest svn version of the compiler <b>before</b>
       contacting the list.  There are insufficient resources to cater for
       older compilers.  You are welcome to spend <b>your</b> time
       back-porting fixes to the older releases.
<li /> In short: <b>think</b>.  "Will the people receiving this have to
       be mind-readers in order to answer my question?".  "What work
       will <b>they</b> have to do, to get <b>me</b> the results that
       <b>I</b> want?"
<li /> Give <i>some</i> sort of clear indication of a willingness to
       work with the people of the list to resolve the issue that you
       have.  A "hello, I'm new here, thank you in advance for any
       help" is usually all it takes, making the difference between
       the reader deciding to provide a terse but informative reply or
       a more detailed (and probably more useful) one.
<li /> When you get a response, <b>do what you've been recommended to do!</b>
       You got an answer, so why would you want to be disrespectful to the
       person who spent their personal time and money in composing a reply,
       by <b>not</b> following their advice?  If you don't understand the
       reply, that's fine - <i>say so</i>: there's no harm in saying,
       "I don't understand".
<li /> The other alternative is: if you're not going to do what you've
       been recommended to do, give <i>really</i> good reasons as to why.
       The point is: don't risk alienating the very people you need help
       from, in order to fix the problem.  Entertain them with the
       antics that you're getting up to by getting into a horribly
       tangly mess: yes.  Irritate them by wasting their time: no.
<li /> Once you've managed to solve a problem (in part or in full),
       <i>say so</i>.  And, if the solution involved following advice
       given, <i>say thank you!</i>.  The former is important for anyone
       else who may encounter the same problem.  The latter is important
       for if you want to ask their advice ever again.  If you don't
       say "thank you", don't be surprised to get a curt response next
       time, if you get one at all.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<i>[Personal note from lkcl: I've done a lot of free software development,
and I've never, despite trying, been able to cover exactly everything,
first time, on reporting a problem / asking for help.  Software development
is complex.  "Full" reports are rare and time-consuming for the person
writing them, but that's just part of <b>your</b> job of writing <b>your</b>
app.  The key thing is that there should be enthusiasm behind
what you're doing: a good developer on a free software project will be
able to instantly tell that you're being enthusiastic (and are showing
a willingness to adapt), and will likely make allowances that they would
otherwise not tolerate.
The bottom line is, therefore: use your judgement; provide as much
information and context as you can; give some sort of indication of
willingness to follow the advice given; follow the advice
given; provide people with evidence that you've followed it (or an
explanation as to why you haven't), and say thank you if the advice helped.]

</p>

<h3> My application doesn't work.  What do I do, and why isn't Pyjamas helping? </h3>
<p>
There are so many things you should be doing to determine the cause
of "it ain't working" it's almost unreal.  But before answering
in more detail, it's important that you know what pyjamas is and
is not.  First off: pyjamas is a compiler, not a debugger.  It's the
equivalent of "gcc".  Actually, if you know how gcc works, pyjsbuild
is the equivalent of "gcc" and pyjscompile is the equivalent of,
for example, "/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.3.3/cc1".  In other
words, gcc and pyjsbuild are the general-purpose "front-ends",
and cc1 and pyjscompile are the actual nitty-gritty compilers.
</p>
<p>
You <i>need</i> to be aware of this because you cannot expect pyjamas,
a specialist compiler, to also take on the task of being the debugger, 
or to incorporate the tasks performed by tools such as pylint, or to be
the virtual machine under which the javascript executes, or to be
a javascript code-compressor, or to do any other task <i>other</i> than
actual compiling.
</p>
<p>
With that in mind, here are some things that you can do:
<ul>
<li /> Add the -d option to the build process: pyjsbuild -d {myapp.py}.
       It's the equivalent of adding "-g" to gcc.
       -d will enable a horrendous amount of extra output in the
       application, including actually placing the line numbers and
       module name into the javascript output, for each and every single
       line of code being executed (!)  Also, a stacktrace will be
       recorded so that if there are any exceptions in your application,
       an Alert will come up with the full stacktrace (just like in
       "real" python applications).
<li /> Watch the Javascript Console.
<li /> Watch the Javascript Console.
<li /> Watch the Javascript Console.
<li /> Did we say, and emphasise enough, that you need to watch the Javascript
       Console?
<li /> You need to watch the javascript console.
<li /> You need to watch the javascript console because that is where
       runtime javascript errors are shown.  Most web applications are written
       so badly that the errors are usually silently ignored by browsers,
       so as not to frighten users.  As a developer, you cannot ignore
       the errors (not if you expect to actually be able to write an app,
       that is...)
<li /> If you are using Firefox, install <i>both</i> Venkman <b>and</b>
       Firebug.  You will need them both.  Use them.  get used to using them.
<li /> If you are using IE, install the Script Debugger.  use it.
<li /> If you were debugging a c or c++ application, you would be using gdb.
       The javascript console, Firebug, Venkman, the Microsoft Script Debugger:
       these are all the equivalent of gdb.  use them.  You will suck at
       being a Web developer if you do not use these tools.
<li /> Install <a href="http://pyjd.org">Pyjamas Desktop</a> and run your
       application under that.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Overall, then, it's important to remember that pyjamas is a compiler,
not an interpreter, not a debugger, syntax checker or anything else other
than a compiler.  This may be a bit of a shock if you are used to the
python interpreter throwing helpful stack traces for you - which is what
Pyjamas-Desktop is there for: it actually runs Pyjamas applications
<i>as real python</i>, not as javascript.

</p>

<h3> I want to throw some debug output onto the screen, how do I best do that?</h3>

<p>
There are four main ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li /> If you like, throw in lots of "alerts" into your application.
<pre class="code">
from pyjamas import Window
Window.alert("Hello, here is an error")
</pre>
<li /> My favourite: add some HTML to the end of the page:
<pre class="code">
from pyjamas.ui.RootPanel import RootPanel
from pyjamas.ui.HTML import HTML
RootPanel().add(HTML("hello, here is an error")
</pre>
<li /> Another approach is to follow what examples/libtest/write.py does,
which you should just consider blatantly copying:
<pre class="code">
from pyjamas import DOM

def getBodyElement():
    JS(""" return $doc.body; """)

def write(text):
    global data
    data += text
    DOM.setInnerHTML(element, data)

def writebr(text):
    write(text + "&lt;br /&gt;\n")

data = ""
element = DOM.createDiv()
DOM.appendChild(getBodyElement(), element)
</pre>
<li /> If you have followed the advice above of the previous question,
and have installed Firebug, then just insert a "print" statement, exactly
as you would in "standard" python.  All output is directed to "console.write",
where Firebug will add an object called "console" to the global namespace
of your browser, and will "write" anything that goes to that console.write()
function into a special debugging window.  If you haven't installed Firebug,
and you use "print", you will get an error (because there will be no object
called "console") in your browser's global namespace.  So make your life
easier, and install Firebug.  or not.
</ul>
<p>
A Window.alert is the easiest but also the most annoying.  It has the
advantage however of not disrupting the screen layout.  Perhaps
some day someone will do something really sophisticated, like provide
a "logger" module which throws up a nice separate window.
</p>

<h3> The UI Widgets create table layouts.  I hate table layouts! Tables Suck! </h3>
<p>
In the Immortal Words of Bjorne Again, at the free concert on Parker's Piece,
Cambridge, in the mid 1990's, <i>"Tough Titty: We Play Abba, Now"</i>.
But seriously - this is a Desktop-like Widget Set.  You use the high-level
API.  Why would you care if the low-level implementation, which you're
never going to have to get involved with, uses HTML Tables instead of your
personal preference, CSS "div" pseudo-tables?
</p>
<p>
Also, think about this: your personal preference, for CSS pseudo-tables,
is based on an aversion that was brainwashed into you from having to
hand-code and hard-code HTML markup.  If you use hand-coded hard-coded
HTML in Pyjamas for complex layout, you're <i>really</i> doing something
wrong.  The whole point of Pyjamas is to leverage the simplicity and ease
of the Python programming language, along with a declarative programming
style, to create an application in terms of Widgets, not in terms of HTML.
</p>
<p>
Not only that, but the whole reason why CSS pseudo-tables are recommended
over HTML tables is because of lack of control over layout.  Well, with
the declarative programming style from Pyjamas UI Widgets, that lack of
control when compared to static HTML is <i>more</i> than adequately
compensated for.  For example, you can easily use Window Resize Change
Notify to completely restructure the application layout, dynamically
(see <a href="http://lkcl.net">lkcl.net</a> for an example, including
<a href="http://lkcl.net/site_code">source</a>), or you can just resize
the Grid itself and its child widgets to fit 100% on-screen, as is done
in the Pyjamas
<a href="http://pyjs.org/examples/mail/output/Mail.html">Mail</a>
example.
</p>
<p>
Then, also, there's what happens when you create a CSS pseudo-table,
and a user shrinks the screen size.  What happens?  The layout goes
completely haywire, because by hard-coding the width of the outer DIV,
the inner items now have nowhere to go, and thus your site looks
absolutely rubbish.  Summary: CSS pseudo-tables are not the panacea
you were expecting.
</p>
<p>
So, the short version is: Pyjamas U.I. Widgets provide far more flexibility
and better layout than either of the two "plain" / "static" HTML solutions.
Ultimately, if you <i>really</i> don't like the HTML-based widgets, feel
free to create your own, and submit a patch.
</p>

<h3> The output from Pyjamas is <i>really</i> verbose.  I don't like that! </h3>
<p>
Pyjamas is a compiler - it's a specialist tool that focusses specifically
on the job of turning python into javascript.  It does <i>not</i>
include "compression" technology.  That task is done by specialist
technology such as the "YUI Javascript Compressor", the use of which
will make it damn hard for you to debug an application as it completely
trashes all of the names of functions and variables.  So only make use
of compressors if you absolutely have to.
</p>
<p>
HTTP 1.1 GZip Compression is usually enabled by default in both
browsers and Web Servers, giving anywhere between an 8:1 and a 10:1
compression ratio in network traffic of pyjamas-compiled output.
So, although the output from pyjamas looks scarily large, it's
actually not as bad as it looks.  500k is not uncommon: the actual
amount of network traffic can be as little as 50k to 80k, which you
can verify by installing a network sniffer on your network.  So,
you actually get the best of both worlds: human-readable javascript
and efficient transfer of your application to the users.
</p>

<h3> The output from Pyjamas is still too verbose.  What do I do? </h3>
<p>
If for example your app is so large that you are hitting, for example,
the limits of GAE, you can switch on "dynamic module" compilation
(pyjsbuild -m).  This option will split your app into several shared
javascript files, one per python module.  It gives something like a
65% reduction in the size of the application cache files, across the
five supported browsers (Opera, Safari, Netscape, Old Mozilla and IE).
It's only just been added (to Pyjamas 0.5) so a) be advised b) watch
this space.
</p>

<h3> I'm doing JSONRPC with pyjamas, but my app isn't working.  </h3>
<p>
You should immediately stop trying to do too much, and eliminate pyjamas
from the equation.  Download
<a href="http://lkcl.net/jsonrpclib.tgz">jsonrpclib.tgz</a> and add
some python-based client-side code to the <i>server-side</i> testing.
As you are a good web developer, who follows good code standard practices,
this should have already occurred to you and it just temporarily slipped
your mind that there should be an automated test suite based on something
like jsonrpclib.tgz which you can use to <i>prove</i> to yourself that
the JSONRPC server-side services of your app are absolutely perfect.
You already considered the distinct advantages of being able to do
automated tests such as pretending to be a user, interacting with the
server-side forms, adding and deleting of records etc., but you had
juuust not quite got round to doing that yet.  well - now you have to.
</p>
<p>
Once you have demonstrated to your satisfaction that there is nothing
wrong with the JSONRPC services, you can then reintroduce Pyjamas,
as a second client, into the equation.  The difference between then
and now is that you now <i>know</i> that there is nothing wrong with
the JSONRPC services, server-side.  So, anything that's wrong has to be
something like you've specified the wrong URL in the use of the
pyjamas.JSONService module.  Check that the URL is the same as the
one that you used in the client-side usage of the python jsonrpclib.
</p>
<p>
You <b>have</b> to remember that you are using AJAX, with JSONRPC. So,
the same standard rules apply: you can <b>not</b> access AJAX URLs
other than those which match the URL from where the web browser downloaded
the HTML and the Javascript.  In other words, if your app is downloaded
from http://fred.foo.com/myapp.html, then you can <b>not</b> put
http://fred.foo.com:8080/jsonservice as the URL for the JSONRPC service,
you can <b>not</b> put http://somewhere.else.com as the URL.  It
<b>has</b> to be http://fred.foo.com/somewhere.
</p>
<p>
Welcome to the world where people used to use AJAX to do cross-site
scripting attacks, downloading viruses and doing phishing attacks and
other crap, but can't any more, and you, as a developer, have to pay
for that.
</p>

<h3> I've upgraded to Pyjamas 0.5 (or above) and I get a blank screen.  </h3>
<p>
You should have read the CHANGELOG, which says this:
<pre>
    convert app "loading" to require the use of "if __name__ == '__main__'"
    bringing pyjamas into line with "standard" python.  apps can convert with
    contrib/pyjamas_0.4-0.5_upgrade/add_name_main.py to add a small codefragment
    at the end: "app = MyApp(); app.onModuleLoad()"
</pre>
</p>
<p>
In other words, Pyjamas 0.4 and below used to spoon-feed you by calling
a function "onModuleLoad()" in the exact same class as named after your
application.  As this is somewhat tacky, and places an unnecessary restriction
onto how you can lay out your app, it was removed, and replaced with something
that is much more akin to how a "standard" desktop python app would work.
</p>
<p>
The consequences are that your apps will, if you don't explicitly do anything,
do absolutely nothing.  So, when you get a blank screen, that is actually
technically correct, as exactly the same thing would happen with a standard
python app!  Declare an instance of your app's class and call its
onModuleLoad() function.
</p>

<h3> I've upgraded to svn r785 or greater (or Pyjamas 0.6) and I want to use PyJD </h3>
<p>
svn r785 or so started supporting XULRunner (python-xpcom) as well as 
pywebkitgtk, and underwent something of a minor code-shuffle, to make
the style of PyJD apps look much more like PyQT4 / PyGTK2.  So, for example,
instead of gtk.main() you would do pyjd.run().  There's also some "setup"
required, which kick-starts the underlying web engine into life.  In
a web browser (PyJS) of course the web browser is already running (duh)
so pyjd.setup() and pyjd.run() do nothing, in PyJS.  The functions still
have to be there, of course, so that the app can be identical under both
PyJD and PyJS.  To convert apps to use PyJD, add three lines:
</p>
<pre class="code">
# at top:
import pyjd # this is a dummy in pyjs and has no effect

# rest of imports
...
...

# declare classes etc.
...
...

# at bottom:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # equivalent to starting a web browser, does nothing
    # in pyjs, because duh, you're already running the web
    # browser.
    pyjd.setup("./public/{thehtmlloaderfile}.html")
    ...
    ...
    # last line
    pyjd.run() # equivalent to gtk.run and does nothing in pyjs
</pre>

<h3>I love/prefer {insert AJAX / Javascript framework here}, how do I use it?</h3>
<p>
Not being funny or anything, but unless you have the resources of google
or lots of money or lots of time, or you can gather enough people to make
it so that everyone has less work to do: you don't.
</p>

<h3>huh? why?? Some of the widgets in DojoX / Ext-JS are really cute!  I want them! waaah!</h3>
<p>
You are not in Kansas any more.  Pyjamas is declarative-style programming,
using a "real" programming language.  All those widget-sets were designed
to be driven from inside HTML (a style of web development which, using
Pyjamas, you have just left far behind) and by inserting javascript snippets
into the HTML.  If you try that with a Pyjamas app, you are not only likely
to get yourself into an awful mess, but also you will be unlikely to run
the same (python-based) app under Pyjamas-Desktop, as you will still have
a Javascript dependency.  You <i>can</i> run javascript under Pyjamas-Desktop
but it's not easy to interact with (the python code) which is why we went
to all the trouble of replacing all the javascript with equivalent python,
doing exactly the same things with python-DOM bindings rather than
javascript-DOM bindings.
</p>
<p>
Shoe-horning an alien AJAX toolkit into Pyjamas takes a considerable amount
of attention to detail, and is also likely to have unintended side-effects
as the two interact.  Not only that, but you are in for a bit of a shock when
you actually start looking at the number of lines of code in some of these
javascript "rich" widget tooklits, and an even bigger one when it comes to
linking the two together.
</p>
<p>
Take gwt-ext as a successful example of a wrapper between GWT and ExtJS.
The "startup" glue code is 8,000 lines of dedicated javascript, the sole
purpose of which is to get extjs initialised in a way that's compatible
with GWT.  8,000 lines of javascript is about 70% the size of the entire
pyjamas codebase, including widget set and compiler, at the time of writing.
Then, the "wrappers" are a further whopping 80,000 lines of Java-javascript
hybrid.
</p>
<p>
So, at the end of all that work, you have a wrapper which is itself a
monstrous hybrid to maintain, which will need changing every time the
Javascript Widget Library API changes, and, on top of that, if the
Javascript Widget Library doesn't do what you want, you are screwed,
because the whole reason why you're here working with Pyjamas is because
you prefer working with python instead of Javascript.  And if there's
a bug - one that wasn't introduced by the custom-written wrapper - in
the Javascript Widget Library itself, then you still have to delve into
Javascript and fix it.
</p>
<p>
Overall, then, does it not make much more sense to rewrite the "pretty"
widget in python, and contribute it to the community under the same
license (Apache 2.0) so that everyone else in the Pyjamas community can
benefit from it and help you improve it?  Especially since the amount
of code that you will be writing will be significantly less than if you
tried the same thing in Java or Javascript.
</p>
<p>
So, instead of hurting yourself with javascript, perhaps you might like
to consider enjoying Web programming, using python?
</p>
<h3>I'm installing hulahop and python-xpcom on Pyjamas-Desktop on Ubuntu 9, but it don't work, it all broke!</h3>
<p>
Yep.  Someone didn't bother to check that python-hulahop actually
worked, in Ubuntu 9 before uploading it.  You'll need to rebuild
the python-hulahop package, from source:
<pre>
&gt;https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sugar-hulahop/+bug/390475
&gt; 
&gt; Just to be clear I'm running from svn and it works on Ubuntu if you
&gt; rebuild python-hulahop to get the python 2.6 bindings you don't need
&gt; to set the python path to xulrunner.

nice one michael - thank you for investigating.
</pre>

You can download a couple of .debs <a href="http://lkcl.net/pyjamas">here</a>
for ubuntu 9, i386 architecture.  
</p>
<h3>I'm evaluating GWT and Pyjamas, and I don't know which one to choose.</h3>
<p>
 You're comparing apples and oranges.  You're comparing a community-led
 effort against a corporate-funded one; you're comparing a good couple of
 hundred thousand lines of code against tens of thousands; you're
 comparing a strongly-typed language against a dynamically-typed one;
 you're comparing a system which is tightly integrated into the Eclipse
 IDE against one which follows the unix ethos to "do one thing and do it well".
</p>
<p>
 you really do need to look at the differences between the GWT
 infrastructure and the Pyjamas infrastructure.  take a look for
 example at GWT's i18n and l10n internationalisation support: it's
 _tens_ of thousands of lines of code, and _hundreds_ of files,
 supporting over one hundred individual languages, each with number
 formats, date formats and so on.  pyjamas internationalisation
 support: a pattern, comprising about .... 50 lines of code, because
 in over a year of development, only two people have ever asked about
 how to do internationalisation of applications.
</p>
<p>
  our focus, as a community effort rather than a google-corporate-full-
  time-multi-man-team-funded effort, is therefore on the tools and the
  infrastructure that _we the contributors_ need and enjoy working on,
  which is a much smaller subset of functionality than "that which
  'employees of google' are tasked with".
</p>
<p>
   so, like lovelysystems, who have some amazing python and javascript
   engineers, you should utilise pyjamas if a) you feel that the use of
   GWT's infrastructure and libraries is not going to be worth tolerating
   the pain barrier of java b) you are prepared to dive in to the (very
   compact and readable) pyjamas libraries if the code doesn't do what
   you need, and to contribute.
</p>

<h3>How can i "trust" the pyjamas compiler?</h3>
<p>
There's a simple answer: <a href="http://pyjs.org/examples/libtest/output/LibTest.html">the regression tests</a>
   these regression tests actually run under the standard python prompt,
   so you add a test, run it in standard python, then compile it and test
   it in the browser.
</p>
<p>
   we are also working to get the regression tests to run under
   spidermonkey (the mozilla js command-tool), python-spidermonkey (the
   python bindings to the spidermonkey library) and pyv8 (the python
   bindings by flier liu - http://code.google.com/p/pyv8 - to the google
   v8 library).
</p>
<p>
   once _that_ is done, then there is the plan to start running the
   STANDARD http://python.org regression tests, all 25,000+ of them,
   through the pyjamas compiler.
   yes, this is possible.  basically, pyjamas becomes a python
   accelerator, by translating to javascript and using the JIT google v8
   engine to execute the resultant code.  
</p>
<p>
    Ultimately, though: trust is always given.  In other words: it's
    entirely up to you.
</p>
<h3>I'm getting memory leaks in IE6 under XP and Win2000</h3>
<p>
See MS KB974455.  Basically: nothing to do with pyjamas.  Apply known 
MS patches.
