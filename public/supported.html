<h2>Pyjamas Python-to-Javascript Language Features</h2>
<p>
The pyjamas python-to-javascript compiler is actually a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translator_(computing)">language translator</a>.
It has two main modes: -O and --strict.  The --strict mode aims for
<i>full</i> python interoperability, even at the expense of performance,
whilst the -O mode is, like gcc's -O option, "optimised" for speed,
even at the expense of missing out certain python language features
and relying on javascript instead.
The <a href="./wiki/migrationguide">Migration Guide</a>
best describes the differences.
</p>
<h2>Supported syntax</h2>
<p>
The majority of python 2.5, and parts of python 2.6 syntax are supported,
including yield <i>despite</i> only one web browser engine having support
for ECMAScript "yield" (which is <b>not</b> used).  The yield support is
implemented as a state machine, rewriting the code so that it is re-entrant,
and can resume on each yield.  The features <i>not</i> supported are
pretty small and obscure, and include for example, at the time of writing,
assignment to variables of list items in for-loop syntax is not
(<tt>for [a, b] in enumerate(l)</tt>), whereas
assignment to tuples is (<tt>for (a, b) in enumerate(l)</tt>).
Overall it is best to read the
<a href="./wiki/migrationguide">Migration Guide</a>
and go from there.
</p>
<p>
Multiple inheritance is also supported, as is the creation of
metaclasses using three arguments to the builtin "type" function
(but a call to "type" with only one argument is not supported,
and you should be using isinstance for that, anyway).  Object
introspection is supported, as are decorators, static methods,
exceptions and so on.  __new__ however, at the time of writing,
is a little iffy.  unicode is <i>not</i> supported, as it would be
horrendous to implement in javascript, but the long type <i>is</i>
supported, emulated correctly as javascript.
</p>
<p>
One particular feature worth noting: the pyjamas python-to-javascript compiler
uses the internal features of python (its compile module) to turn python into
an Abstract Syntax Tree.   This has - had - the disadvantage that the compiler
is - was - tied to one specific version of python (2.5).  As of Pyjamas 
0.6, it has become possible to use anything from
python 2.4 and upwards to compile code with python 2.5 syntax, using the
"--internal-ast" option.  A port of lib2to3 was used as the basis for an
AST which is identical to that created by the c-code in the http://python.org
compiler.  The plan is to use this at some point to implement "exec" and
"eval" builtins, but it has the nice side-effect of allowing people who
can only use specific versions of python to reliably compile pyjamas python
into javascript.
</p>
<p>
Overall, the general rule is that whoever wants or needs something, they
either work around the limitations of javascript and the pyjs implementation,
or they provide a patch to improve the compiler/translator.
</p>

<h2>Supported modules</h2>
<p>
Additionally, the python-to-javascript compiler has available to it some
implementations of standard python modules, either in pure python or in
hybrid javascript and using web browser built-ins.  Here is a list of the
current python modules that are partially supported.  They have all been
contributed by pyjamas developers, and anyone wishing to have particular
features that are not yet included should simply write them and submit them
as a patch:
</p>
<pre>
    base64.py
    binascii.py
    csv.py
    datetime.py
    math.py
    md5.py
    os.py
    _random.py
    random.py
    re.py
    sets.py
    struct.py
    sys.py
    time.py
    urllib.py
</pre>

<h2>Supported built-ins</h2>
<p>
Here, also, is a list of supported built-in functions, classes and types.
Again: these have been contributed by various pyjamas developers, and again,
if there is a particular function or feature missing, it can be submitted
as a patch.
