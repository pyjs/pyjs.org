<h2>Writing a Widget for Pyjamas</h2>
<p>
    An important part of a widget toolkit is being able to write your
    own widgets.  In many widget sets, you are confronted immediately with
    a quite complex set of unusual-looking functions - paint, draw,
    refresh and other manipulations.  Pyjamas has none of that: in both
    Pyjamas and Pyjamas-Desktop you're manipulating the DOM model - an
    HTML page - as if it was an XML document.  Better than that: unlike
    with manipulating an HTML page, you don't have to get involved with
    Javascript - unless you want to.  Pyjamas provides a module which
    makes the job of controlling the underlying DOM model that much easier,
    and this tutorial shows step-by-step how to go about creating your
    own widget.
</p>
<p>
    Missing from the HTML specification, but present in Adobe Flash, is
    things like sliders and dials.  Many Desktop widget sets have them, so
    it makes a lot of sense to create one.  We'll start with a simple
    Vertical scroller which receives "mouse click" to change the position.
    (For those people who would like to see the completed source code and
    the simple application in action, click <a href="./controls">here</a>
    and <a href="http://github.com/lkcl/pyjamas-desktop/tree/master/pyjamas-webkit/pyjamas/Controls.py">here</a>).
</p>
<h3>Vertical Slider</h3>
<p>
    We start off by importing the DOM model and, because the slider will
    receive mouse (and later keyboard) events, we base it on FocusWidget.
    FocusWidget has the means to add keyboard and event listeners, set
    a "tab order" index, and to set and clear focus:
</p>
<pre class="code">
from pyjamas import DOM
from pyjamas.ui import FocusWidget
</pre>
<p>
    So, we derive our class from FocusWidget.  We don't declare a width
    and height as parameters, because Pyjamas Widgets are based on HTML
    principles: DOM models.  So, you either set the CSS "Class" with
    setStyleName(), or you use the Pyjamas Widget functions setWidth()
    and setHeight().  We <i>do</i> however want to pass in the slider's
    minimum, maximum and default values, and we may also want to keep
    track of who might be interested to know that the slider's value
    has changed.  This is an important point to emphasise: your widgets
    should not impose "look" onto users - that should, ideally be
    defined through CSS: your Widget Class API should be about 
    "function" rather than "form".  So - the constructor for the
    widget has minimum, maximum and default values <i>not</i> width
    and height.
</p>
<pre class="code">
class VerticalDemoSlider(FocusWidget):

    def __init__(self, min_value, max_value, start_value=None):

        element = DOM.createDiv()
        FocusWidget.__init__(self, element)

        self.min_value = min_value
        self.max_value = max_value
        if start_value is None:
            start_value = min_value
        self.value = start_value
        self.valuechange_listeners = []
</pre>
<p>
    Here also is the first actual bit of underlying HTML / DOM model
    showing through: we're basing the widget on a "div" tag, hence we
    call DOM.createDiv() and set that as the FocusWidget's element.
    (Immediately, therefore, you can see that the Pyjamas Widgets
    are effectively... "guardian" classes that look after and
    manipulate bits of the underlying DOM model, making the whole
    process of creating and maintaining your application just that
    little bit easier to understand).
    We're also going to copy what AbsolutePanel.__init__() does,
    making the container DIV free-moving, and we're also going to throw
    in a second hard-coded "div" for the actual slider handle:
</p>
<pre class="code">
        DOM.setStyleAttribute(element, "position", "relative")
        DOM.setStyleAttribute(element, "overflow", "hidden") 

        self.handle = DOM.createDiv()
        DOM.appendChild(element, self.handle)
</pre>
<p>
    Then, as this is just a demonstration, we're going to hand-code the
    slider handle with some attributes, making it 10 pixels high, a border
    of 1 pixel, fixing it to be the same width as the Widget, and making it
    a grey colour.  A much better way to do this would be to set a CSS
    stylesheet where people could over-ride all these settings.  Note that
    we don't use DOM.setAttribute() to set the border, width and height.
    You should consult HTML specifications: you will find that "border"
    is an attribute for DOM tags such as "table".  So, if you try to
    call DOM.setAttribute() on a DIV tag, you'll find that it silently
    fails in the browser - or if you remember, and examine the Javascript
    Console, you <i>might</i> be lucky and find a warning.  However, if
    you try the same thing under <a href="http://pyjd.org">Pyjamas-Desktop</a>
    you will be rewarded with a much more useful run-time error.
    The upshot is: pay attention to the underlying DOM model, and remember
    to simultaneously develop your app using <i>both</i> Pyjamas <i>and</i>
    Pyjamas-Desktop, to save yourself a great deal of time.  If you want 
    to set a border on a "div" tag, you must set it as a CSS Style attribute:
</p>
<pre class="code">
    DOM.setStyleAttribute(self.handle, "border", "1px")
    DOM.setStyleAttribute(self.handle, "width", "100%")
    DOM.setStyleAttribute(self.handle, "height", "10px")
    DOM.setStyleAttribute(self.handle, "backgroundColor", "#808080")
</pre>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>
    With the basic beginnings, it's enough to test out, to see if we have
    it working.  If all we wanted was a little grey box in our widget, we'd
    be entirely done.
</p>
<pre class="code">
""" testing our demo slider
"""
from pyjamas.ui import RootPanel
from pyjamas.Controls import VerticalDemoSlider

class ControlDemo:
    def onModuleLoad(self):
        b = VerticalDemoSlider(0, 100)
        RootPanel().add(b)
        b.setWidth("20px")
        b.setHeight("100px")
</pre>
<p>
    One thing I love about Pyjamas: this is enough code to do exactly what you
    want: create our slider, add it to the root panel, set its width to 20
    pixels and the height to 100.  Couldn't get any easier.  A quick run of
    this code shows that yes, indeed, we have a little grey box, which is
    very exciting.  Next on the list is to make it move, and for that,
    we'll add a "click listener".
</p>
<h3>Making it move</h3>
<p>
    To receive a click event, we use FocusWidget.addClickListener().  We're
    going to make the widget itself receive the mouse click event.  Looking
    at FocusWidget.onBrowserEvent(), we can see that we must add a function
    called onClick() to our VerticalDemoSlider.  As we want to know <i>where</i>
    the mouse was clicked, we will need to add two arguments to the onClick()
    function, in order to receive the mouse event object as the second.
    Then, we simply take the mouse event y position, the absolute location
    of the container, and the "offset height" of the widget, do a little
    math and, copying some lines of code from AbsolutePanel.setWidgetPosition,
    we can change the location of the slider handle:
</p>
<pre class="code">
        def onClick(self, sender, event):

            # work out the relative position of cursor
            mouse_y = DOM.eventGetClientY(event) - \
                       DOM.getAbsoluteTop(sender.getElement())
            self.moveSlider(mouse_y)

        def moveSlider(self, mouse_y):

            relative_y = mouse_y - DOM.getAbsoluteTop(self.getElement())
            widget_height = self.getOffsetHeight()

            # limit the position to be in the widget!
            if relative_y < 0:
                relative_y = 0
            height_range = widget_height - 10 # handle height is hard-coded
            if relative_y >= height_range:
                relative_y = height_range

            # move the handle
            DOM.setStyleAttribute(self.handle, "top", "%dpx" % relative_y)
            DOM.setStyleAttribute(self.handle, "position", "absolute")

</pre>
<p>
    Okay - let's test it!  Save, run... lights, camera, action, aaand...
    nothing.  huh.  What have we done wrong?  Oh yes, we forgot a very
    important line.  Go back to VerticalDemoSlider.__init__ and add this,
    at the end, and try again:
<pre class="code">
        self.addClickListener(self)
</pre>
<p>
    Amazing!  We have a slider widget!  A single-click moves the slider to
    where you clicked the mouse.  Notice how the slider centre moves to where
    your mouse pointer actually points to: this is entirely a fluke, and is
    probably due to bugs in the CSS style implementation of your browser.
    Notice also that we haven't actually set the value of the "slider", but
    there's enough maths to calculate it.  We can add these extra lines
    on to the end of moveSlider():
</p>
<pre class="code">
        val_diff = self.max_value - self.min_value
        new_value = ((val_diff * relative_y) / height_range) + self.min_value
        self.setValue(new_value)
</pre>
<p>
    Then, we also add a setValue() function, which not only records the
    new value but also notifies any listeners.  Copying the style of
    Label and other widgets' addClickListener() and removeClickListener()
    functions, we're doing addControlValueListener() and
    removeControlValueListener() to match.
</p>
<pre class="code">
    def setValue(self, new_value):

        old_value = self.value
        self.value = new_value
        for listener in self.valuechange_listeners:
            listener.onControlValueChanged(self, old_value, new_value)

    def addControlValueListener(self, listener):
        self.valuechange_listeners.append(listener)

    def removeControlValueListener(self, listener):
        self.valuechange_listeners.remove(listener)

</pre>
<p>
    Now we should really see if that works.  In the "test code",
    add these extra lines to ControlDemo.onModuleLoad() and also
    add the additional function onControlValueChanged:
</p>
<pre class="code">
        b.addControlValueListener(self)
        self.label = Label("Not set yet")
        RootPanel().add(self.label)

    def onControlValueChanged(self, slider, old_value, new_value):
        self.label.setText("Value: %d" % int(new_value))
</pre>
<p>
    A quick run of this shows our
    <a href="./controls/output/ControlDemo.html">Control Demo app</a>
    has a very boring
    Text Label 200 pixels underneath a grey box, with the words
    "Not set yet".  Clicking anywhere between the box and the words
    not only moves the slider, but also changes the text to say
    "Value: 83" or something to that effect.  Amazing.
</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>
    Congratulations, you have a slider, in 70 lines of python code, and
    a demonstration of its use in 20.  You can click on it.  Please
    feel free to resist the urge to press the up and down arrows and
    to click and hold the mouse: it won't work.  Adding that functionality
    will be for another day's hacking, which you're welcome to send to
    me (<a href="mailto:lkcl@lkcl.net">lkcl@lkcl.net</a>) and I will
    add it in.
</p>
<p>
    Hints: look at Image.onBrowserEvent() - you will notice that it
    differs from FocusWidget.onBrowserEvent() in that it also handles
    mouse move, enter, leave and up.  These events all get passed
    to an instance of MouseListener(), calling its fireMouseEvent()
    function.  Then, look at DialogBox and notice that it does all
    sorts of strange and wonderful things, including the use of
    "capture":
</p>
<pre class="code">
    def onMouseDown(self, sender, x, y):
        self.dragging = True
        DOM.setCapture(self.caption.getElement())
        self.dragStartX = x
        self.dragStartY = y
</pre>
<p>
    This is pretty important - to set "capture" of all mouse events.
    In the case of the Dialog Box, the events are captured by the
    "caption" at the top of the box, which is the "drag bar".  That
    sounds... very much exactly like what we want, so feel free to
    cut-and-paste DialogBox's onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseMove,
    onMouseLeave and onMouseEnter functions; remember to call
    VerticalDemoSlider.moveSlider() not setPopupPosition(); and remember
    to take a copy e.g. of Image.onBrowserEvent(), or take a copy
    of FocusWidget.onBrowserEvent() and extend it with these all-important
    lines:
</p>
<pre class="code">
        elif type == "mouseup" or type == "mousemove" or type == "mouseover" or type == "mouseout":
            MouseListener().fireMouseEvent(self.mouseListeners, self, event)
</pre>
<p>
    That should give you a slider which now accepts mouse drag-move
    events, making it that little bit much more useful than one which
    deals in single-clicks.  Once you've done that, of course, you might
    want to remove the onClick() altogether, because of course a
    single-click is also a mouse-down followed by a mouse-up event,
    often, in many cases, accompanied by intermediate but very brief
    mouse-move events.  The end-result will be doubling- or possibly
    tripling- or more of value change notifications, all redundant,
    and all wasting CPU cycles.
</p>
<p>
    Once you've done <i>that</i>, you might also wish to improve the
    widget further by detecting whether or not the mouse position was
    <i>actually</i> changed.  Otherwise, you may end up with entirely
    unnecessary calls to onControlValueChanged().  Don't be tempted to
    short-cut the process by doing "if new_value != old_value", although
    this is, strictly speaking, needed as well.  Record the old mouse
    position on mouse-down, and only start sending onControlValueChanged()
    notifications when the mouse "y" position differs from this recorded
    value.
</p>
<h3>Further enhancements and considerations</h3>
<p>
    As part of a c++ widget set I helped develop and maintain in 1992
    we had "ganging" sliders, which were for Stereo Volume control.
    We created a "container" widget which allowed us to receive value
    changes from an arbitrary number of "Control" widgets placed
    within it.  The "difference" between the old and new values were
    very important: we utilised these to make changes to the other
    volume slider, allowing users to set the Left volume slightly
    higher or lower than the Right volume, and then, on selecting the
    "Ganging" switch, both volumes would waggle up and down by the
    same amount, without mashing up to the same absolute value: an
    undesirable oversight.
</p>
<p>
    We had quite a lot of fun making test applications with half a dozen
    sliders and dials, waggling one and watching the rest go bananas.
    Given that this was running on 386sx 25mhz systems, it was also
    quite impressive.  As it was a real-time (single-process!) application,
    we had to pay particular attention to ensuring that the priority
    was on getting the volume values to the DSP as fast as possible,
    leaving visual changes as the absolute last priority-queued event.
    Yes, we have a message-event system, like in Windows 3.1, except
    we added "priority" to it, thus avoiding the need for threading
    and still giving the application both responsiveness as well
    as aural and visually accurate representation.
</p>
<p>
    Any good "Control" widget system should keep these principles and
    lessons in mind.
</p>
<h3>Advanced Widgets</h3>
<p>
    So, you read this tutorial: you went wow, big deal: my imagination
    is now unlimited by the wondrous possibilities of being able to
    manipulate the DOM model of a "page" - a screen - in a quick and
    easy fashion.  However, my requirements are beyond what "DOM model"
    can handle.  I want video.  I want 2D graphics.  I want 3D
    graphics.  What do I do?
</p>
<p>
    There are two answers.  The first one is: if your project requires
    advanced 2D graphics manipulation, there is always the SVG Canvas, if
    you have a web browser that can support SVG.  The Pyjamas "Canvas"
    widget has been ported from the GWT Addons, and it works very well.
    Pyjamas-Desktop does not at the moment support SVG, however it is
    on the Roadmap.
</p>
<p>
    Your second <i>really</i> "far out" option - given that the underlying
    technology is web-browser-based - is to use Web Plugins.  For Safari,
    Netscape, Firefox and WebKit (the last in the case of Pyjamas-Desktop),
    you can write a plugin that conforms to the NPAPI standard, and
    you're away.  I recommend that you start with the Adobe Flash plugin
    source code.
</p>
<p>
    But, before you go writing your own 3D, Video or other Multimedia
    plugin, first check to see whether there is an existing NPAPI
    or existing Web-based plugin that you can place into an iframe
    or otherwise embed into a page.  Can you write the plugin in
    Java, and run a Java applet in your page?  Can you use Adobe
    Flash?  All of these possibilites are open to you, with no extra
    particularly complex programming.
</p>
