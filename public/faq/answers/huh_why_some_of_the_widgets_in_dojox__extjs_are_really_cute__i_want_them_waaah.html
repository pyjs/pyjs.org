You are not in Kansas any more.  Pyjamas is declarative-style programming,
using a "real" programming language.  All those widget-sets were designed
to be driven from inside HTML (a style of web development which, using
Pyjamas, you have just left far behind) and by inserting javascript snippets
into the HTML.  If you try that with a Pyjamas app, you are not only likely
to get yourself into an awful mess, but also you will be unlikely to run
the same (python-based) app under Pyjamas-Desktop, as you will still have
a Javascript dependency.  You <i>can</i> run javascript under Pyjamas-Desktop
but it's not easy to interact with (the python code) which is why we went
to all the trouble of replacing all the javascript with equivalent python,
doing exactly the same things with python-DOM bindings rather than
javascript-DOM bindings.
</p>
<p>
Shoe-horning an alien AJAX toolkit into Pyjamas takes a considerable amount
of attention to detail, and is also likely to have unintended side-effects
as the two interact.  Not only that, but you are in for a bit of a shock when
you actually start looking at the number of lines of code in some of these
javascript "rich" widget tooklits, and an even bigger one when it comes to
linking the two together.
</p>
<p>
Take gwt-ext as a successful example of a wrapper between GWT and ExtJS.
The "startup" glue code is 8,000 lines of dedicated javascript, the sole
purpose of which is to get extjs initialised in a way that's compatible
with GWT.  8,000 lines of javascript is about 70% the size of the entire
pyjamas codebase, including widget set and compiler, at the time of writing.
Then, the "wrappers" are a further whopping 80,000 lines of Java-javascript
hybrid.
</p>
<p>
So, at the end of all that work, you have a wrapper which is itself a
monstrous hybrid to maintain, which will need changing every time the
Javascript Widget Library API changes, and, on top of that, if the
Javascript Widget Library doesn't do what you want, you are screwed,
because the whole reason why you're here working with Pyjamas is because
you prefer working with python instead of Javascript.  And if there's
a bug - one that wasn't introduced by the custom-written wrapper - in
the Javascript Widget Library itself, then you still have to delve into
Javascript and fix it.
</p>
<p>
Overall, then, does it not make much more sense to rewrite the "pretty"
widget in python, and contribute it to the community under the same
license (Apache 2.0) so that everyone else in the Pyjamas community can
benefit from it and help you improve it?  Especially since the amount
of code that you will be writing will be significantly less than if you
tried the same thing in Java or Javascript.
</p>
<p>
So, instead of hurting yourself with javascript, perhaps you might like
to consider enjoying Web programming, using python?
