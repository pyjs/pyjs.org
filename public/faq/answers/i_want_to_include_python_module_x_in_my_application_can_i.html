Browsers only support javascript, and pyjs is a python-to-javascript
compiler (strictly speaking, a language translator).  Therefore, any
python module, written in pure python, stands a good chance of working
(such as <a href="http://puremvc.org">PureMVC</a>).  For anything that's
written in c, you stand absolutely zero chance, and that's the end of it.
However, you can always use a python-based Web Server Framework, and
execute whatever python module you choose, server-side, then ship whatever
results you choose back to the browser, just like you would with any other
web application.

<p>
The Pyjamas UI Widget Set and supporting DOM module and other infrastructure
is, by the time it ends up as javascript, absolutely no different from any
other javascript-based Web Browser Framework - <b>other</b> than the fact
that the <b>original</b> language was Python, and other than the fact that
Pyjamas-Desktop exists.  So, you <b>could</b> include python module X in
your application, <b>if</b> you run it under Pyjamas-Desktop - but that is
strongly discouraged, for two reasons.  Firstly, you stand zero chance of
compiling the same application to javascript, should you ever wish to run it
in a Web Browser.  Secondly, the Web Engines used by Pyjamas-Desktop are
effectively single-threaded, and, just like with PyQt4 and PyGTK2, control
must be handed back quickly to the internal top-level event-handling loop.
So, if you execute some CPU-intensive code (in python module X), the entire
application visually grinds to a halt and becomes totally unresponsive, just
like an overloaded Web Browser, waiting for that code to complete.  To avoid
this situation, you should use the exact same asynchronous tricks used when
code is executed in browsers: AJAX to communicate with a Web Server Framework.
(yes, Pyjamas-Desktop supports XMLHttpRequest: for the above reasons,
it is strongly recommended that you use it).
