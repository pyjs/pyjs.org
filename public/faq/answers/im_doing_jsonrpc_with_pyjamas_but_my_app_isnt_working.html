You should immediately stop trying to do too much, and eliminate pyjamas
from the equation.  Download
<a href="http://lkcl.net/jsonrpclib.tgz">jsonrpclib.tgz</a> and add
some python-based client-side code to the <i>server-side</i> testing.
As you are a good web developer, who follows good code standard practices,
this should have already occurred to you and it just temporarily slipped
your mind that there should be an automated test suite based on something
like jsonrpclib.tgz which you can use to <i>prove</i> to yourself that
the JSONRPC server-side services of your app are absolutely perfect.
You already considered the distinct advantages of being able to do
automated tests such as pretending to be a user, interacting with the
server-side forms, adding and deleting of records etc., but you had
juuust not quite got round to doing that yet.  well - now you have to.
</p>
<p>
Once you have demonstrated to your satisfaction that there is nothing
wrong with the JSONRPC services, you can then reintroduce Pyjamas,
as a second client, into the equation.  The difference between then
and now is that you now <i>know</i> that there is nothing wrong with
the JSONRPC services, server-side.  So, anything that's wrong has to be
something like you've specified the wrong URL in the use of the
pyjamas.JSONService module.  Check that the URL is the same as the
one that you used in the client-side usage of the python jsonrpclib.

<p>
You <b>have</b> to remember that you are using AJAX, with JSONRPC. So,
the same standard rules apply: you can <b>not</b> access AJAX URLs
other than those which match the URL from where the web browser downloaded
the HTML and the Javascript.  In other words, if your app is downloaded
from http://fred.foo.com/myapp.html, then you can <b>not</b> put
http://fred.foo.com:8080/jsonservice as the URL for the JSONRPC service,
you can <b>not</b> put http://somewhere.else.com as the URL.  It
<b>has</b> to be http://fred.foo.com/somewhere.
</p>
<p>
Welcome to the world where people used to use AJAX to do cross-site
scripting attacks, downloading viruses and doing phishing attacks and
other crap, but can't any more, and you, as a developer, have to pay
for that.
