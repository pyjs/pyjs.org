 You're comparing apples and oranges.  You're comparing a community-led
 effort against a corporate-funded one; you're comparing a good couple of
 hundred thousand lines of code against tens of thousands; you're
 comparing a strongly-typed language against a dynamically-typed one;
 you're comparing a system which is tightly integrated into the Eclipse
 IDE against one which follows the unix ethos to "do one thing and do it well".

<p>
 you really do need to look at the differences between the GWT
 infrastructure and the Pyjamas infrastructure.  take a look for
 example at GWT's i18n and l10n internationalisation support: it's
 _tens_ of thousands of lines of code, and _hundreds_ of files,
 supporting over one hundred individual languages, each with number
 formats, date formats and so on.  pyjamas internationalisation
 support: a pattern, comprising about .... 50 lines of code, because
 in over a year of development, only two people have ever asked about
 how to do internationalisation of applications.

<p>
  our focus, as a community effort rather than a google-corporate-full-
  time-multi-man-team-funded effort, is therefore on the tools and the
  infrastructure that _we the contributors_ need and enjoy working on,
  which is a much smaller subset of functionality than "that which
  'employees of google' are tasked with".
</p>
<p>
   so, like lovelysystems, who have some amazing python and javascript
   engineers, you should utilise pyjamas if a) you feel that the use of
   GWT's infrastructure and libraries is not going to be worth tolerating
   the pain barrier of java b) you are prepared to dive in to the (very
   compact and readable) pyjamas libraries if the code doesn't do what
   you need, and to contribute.
