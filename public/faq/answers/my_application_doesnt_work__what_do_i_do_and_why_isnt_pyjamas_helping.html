There are so many things you should be doing to determine the cause
of "it ain't working" it's almost unreal.  But before answering
in more detail, it's important that you know what pyjamas is and
is not.  First off: pyjamas is a compiler, not a debugger.  It's the
equivalent of "gcc".  Actually, if you know how gcc works, pyjsbuild
is the equivalent of "gcc" and pyjscompile is the equivalent of,
for example, "/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.3.3/cc1".  In other
words, gcc and pyjsbuild are the general-purpose "front-ends",
and cc1 and pyjscompile are the actual nitty-gritty compilers.
</p>
<p>
You <i>need</i> to be aware of this because you cannot expect pyjamas,
a specialist compiler, to also take on the task of being the debugger, 
or to incorporate the tasks performed by tools such as pylint, or to be
the virtual machine under which the javascript executes, or to be
a javascript code-compressor, or to do any other task <i>other</i> than
actual compiling.
</p>
<p>
With that in mind, here are some things that you can do:
<ul>
<li /> Add the -d option to the build process: pyjsbuild -d {myapp.py}.
       It's the equivalent of adding "-g" to gcc.
       -d will enable a horrendous amount of extra output in the
       application, including actually placing the line numbers and
       module name into the javascript output, for each and every single
       line of code being executed (!)  Also, a stacktrace will be
       recorded so that if there are any exceptions in your application,
       an Alert will come up with the full stacktrace (just like in
       "real" python applications).
<li /> Watch the Javascript Console.
<li /> Watch the Javascript Console.
<li /> Watch the Javascript Console.
<li /> Did we say, and emphasise enough, that you need to watch the Javascript
       Console?
<li /> You need to watch the javascript console.
<li /> You need to watch the javascript console because that is where
       runtime javascript errors are shown.  Most web applications are written
       so badly that the errors are usually silently ignored by browsers,
       so as not to frighten users.  As a developer, you cannot ignore
       the errors (not if you expect to actually be able to write an app,
       that is...)
<li /> If you are using Firefox, install <i>both</i> Venkman <b>and</b>
       Firebug.  You will need them both.  Use them.  get used to using them.
<li /> If you are using IE, install the Script Debugger.  use it.
<li /> If you were debugging a c or c++ application, you would be using gdb.
       The javascript console, Firebug, Venkman, the Microsoft Script Debugger:
       these are all the equivalent of gdb.  use them.  You will suck at
       being a Web developer if you do not use these tools.
<li /> Install <a href="http://pyjd.org">Pyjamas Desktop</a> and run your
       application under that.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Overall, then, it's important to remember that pyjamas is a compiler,
not an interpreter, not a debugger, syntax checker or anything else other
than a compiler.  This may be a bit of a shock if you are used to the
python interpreter throwing helpful stack traces for you - which is what
Pyjamas-Desktop is there for: it actually runs Pyjamas applications
<i>as real python</i>, not as javascript.
