Pyjamas is a compiler - it's a specialist tool that focusses specifically
on the job of turning python into javascript.  It does <i>not</i>
include "compression" technology.  That task is done by specialist
technology such as the "YUI Javascript Compressor", the use of which
will make it damn hard for you to debug an application as it completely
trashes all of the names of functions and variables.  So only make use
of compressors if you absolutely have to.

HTTP 1.1 GZip Compression is usually enabled by default in both
browsers and Web Servers, giving anywhere between an 8:1 and a 10:1
compression ratio in network traffic of pyjamas-compiled output.
So, although the output from pyjamas looks scarily large, it's
actually not as bad as it looks.  500k is not uncommon: the actual
amount of network traffic can be as little as 50k to 80k, which you
can verify by installing a network sniffer on your network.  So,
you actually get the best of both worlds: human-readable javascript
and efficient transfer of your application to the users.
